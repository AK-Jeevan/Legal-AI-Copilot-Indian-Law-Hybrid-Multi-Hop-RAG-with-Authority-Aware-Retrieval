"CHAPTER I : OF THE COMMUNICATION, ACCEPTANCE AND REVOCATION OF PROPOSALS",4,"Communication when complete.— The communication of a proposal is complete when it comes to the knowledge of the person to whom it is made. The communication of an acceptance is complete,— as against the proposer, when it is put in a course of transmission to him, so as to be out of the power of the acceptor; as against the acceptor, when it comes to the knowledge of the proposer. The communication of a revocation is complete,— as against the person who makes it, when it is put into a course of transmission to the person to whom it is made, so as to be out of the power of the person who makes it; as against the person to whom it is made, when it comes to his knowledge."
"CHAPTER I : OF THE COMMUNICATION, ACCEPTANCE AND REVOCATION OF PROPOSALS",5,"Revocation of proposals and acceptances.— A proposal may be revoked at any time before the communication of its acceptance is complete as against the proposer, but not afterwards. An acceptance may be revoked at any time before the communication of the acceptance is complete as against the acceptor, but not afterwards. STATE AMENDMENT: Uttar Pradesh Amendment of section 5.— In section 5 of Indian Contract Act, 1872, at the end of the first paragraph, the following explanation shall be inserted: 'Explanation—Where an invitation to a proposal contains a condition that any proposal made in response to such invitation shall be kept open for a specified time and a proposal is thereupon made accepting such condition, such proposal may not be revoked within such time.'"
"CHAPTER I : OF THE COMMUNICATION, ACCEPTANCE AND REVOCATION OF PROPOSALS",6,"Revocation how made.— A proposal is revoked— (1) by the communication of notice of revocation by the proposer to the other party; (2) by the lapse of the time prescribed in such proposal for its acceptance, or, if no time is so prescribed, by the lapse of a reasonable time, without communication of the acceptance; (3) by the failure of the acceptor to fulfil a condition precedent to acceptance; or (4) by the death or insanity of the proposer, if the fact of his death or insanity comes to the knowledge of the acceptor before acceptance."
"CHAPTER I : OF THE COMMUNICATION, ACCEPTANCE AND REVOCATION OF PROPOSALS",7,"Acceptance must be absolute.— In order to convert a proposal into a promise, the acceptance must— (1) be absolute and unqualified; (2) be expressed in some usual and reasonable manner, unless the proposal prescribes the manner in which it is to be accepted. If the proposal prescribes a manner in which it is to be accepted, and the acceptance is not made in such manner, the proposer may, within a reasonable time after the acceptance is communicated to him, insist that his proposal shall be accepted in the prescribed manner, and not otherwise; but if he fails to do so, he accepts the acceptance."
"CHAPTER I : OF THE COMMUNICATION, ACCEPTANCE AND REVOCATION OF PROPOSALS",8,"Acceptance by performing conditions, or receiving consideration.— Performance of the conditions of a proposal, or the acceptance of any consideration for a reciprocal promise which may be offered with a proposal, is an acceptance of the proposal."

In so far as such proposal or acceptance is made otherwise than in words, the promise is said to be implied."
"CHAPTER II : OF CONTRACTS, VOIDABLE CONTRACTS AND VOID AGREEMENTS",10,"What agreements are contracts.— All agreements are contracts if they are made by the free consent of parties competent to contract, for a lawful consideration and with a lawful object, and are not hereby expressly declared to be void. Nothing herein contained shall affect any law in force in [India] and not hereby expressly repealed by which any contract is required to be made in writing or in the presence of witnesses, or any law relating to the registration of documents."
"CHAPTER II : OF CONTRACTS, VOIDABLE CONTRACTS AND VOID AGREEMENTS",11,"Who are competent to contract.— Every person is competent to contract who is of the age of majority according to the law to which he is subject, and who is of sound mind, and is not disqualified from contracting by any law to which he is subject."
"CHAPTER II : OF CONTRACTS, VOIDABLE CONTRACTS AND VOID AGREEMENTS",12,"What is a sound mind for the purposes of contracting.— A person is said to be of sound mind for the purpose of making a contract, if, at the time when he makes it, he is capable of understanding it and of forming a rational judgment as to its effect upon his interests. A person who is usually of unsound mind, but occasionally of sound mind, may make a contract when he is of sound mind. A person who is usually of sound mind, but occasionally of unsound mind, may not make a contract when he is of unsound mind."
"CHAPTER II : OF CONTRACTS, VOIDABLE CONTRACTS AND VOID AGREEMENTS",13,"'Consent' defined.— Two or more persons are said to consent when they agree upon the same thing in the same sense."
"CHAPTER II : OF CONTRACTS, VOIDABLE CONTRACTS AND VOID AGREEMENTS",14,"'Free consent' defined.— Consent is said to be free when it is not caused by— (1) coercion, as defined in section 15, or (2) undue influence, as defined in section 16, or (3) fraud, as defined in section 17, or (4) misrepresentation, as defined in section 18, or (5) mistake, subject to the provisions of sections 20, 21 and 22. Consent is said to be so caused when it would not have been given but for the existence of such coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation or mistake."
"CHAPTER II : OF CONTRACTS, VOIDABLE CONTRACTS AND VOID AGREEMENTS",15,"'Coercion' defined.— 'Coercion' is the committing, or threatening to commit, any act forbidden by the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) or the unlawful detaining, or threatening to detain, any property, to the prejudice of any person whatever, with the intention of causing any person to enter into an agreement. Explanation.— It is immaterial whether the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) is or is not in force in the place where the coercion is employed."
"CHAPTER II : OF CONTRACTS, VOIDABLE CONTRACTS AND VOID AGREEMENTS",16,"'Undue influence' defined.— (1) A contract is said to be induced by 'undue influence' where the relations subsisting between the parties are such that one of the parties is in a position to dominate the will of the other and uses that position to obtain an unfair advantage over the other. (2) In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing principle, a person is deemed to be in a position to dominate the will of another— (a) where he holds a real or apparent authority over the other, or where he stands in a fiduciary relation to the other; or (b) where he makes a contract with a person whose mental capacity is temporarily or permanently affected by reason of age, illness, or mental or bodily distress. (3) Where a person who is in a position to dominate the will of another, enters into a contract with him, and the transaction appears, on the face of it or on the evidence adduced, to be unconscionable, the burden of proving that such contract was not induced by undue influence shall lie upon the person in a position to dominate the will of the other. Nothing in this sub-section shall affect the provisions of section 111 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (1 of 1872)."
"CHAPTER II : OF CONTRACTS, VOIDABLE CONTRACTS AND VOID AGREEMENTS",17,"'Fraud' defined.— 'Fraud' means and includes any of the following acts committed by a party to a contract, or with his connivance, or by his agent, with intent to deceive another party thereto of his agent, or to induce him to enter into the contract:— (1) the suggestion, as a fact, of that which is not true, by one who does not believe it to be true; (2) the active concealment of a fact by one having knowledge or belief of the fact; (3) a promise made without any intention of performing it; (4) any other act fitted to deceive; (5) any such act or omission as the law specially declares to be fraudulent. Explanation.— Mere silence as to facts likely to affect the willingness of a person to enter into a contract is not fraud, unless the circumstances of the case are such that, regard being had to them, it is the duty of the person keeping silence to speak, or unless his silence is, in itself, equivalent to speech."
"CHAPTER II : OF CONTRACTS, VOIDABLE CONTRACTS AND VOID AGREEMENTS",18,"'Misrepresentation' defined.— 'Misrepresentation' means and includes— (1) the positive assertion, in a manner not warranted by the information of the person making it, of that which is not true, though he believes it to be true; (2) any breach of duty which, without an intent to deceive, gains an advantage to the person committing it, or any one claiming under him; by misleading another to his prejudice, or to the prejudice of any one claiming under him; (3) causing, however innocently, a party to an agreement, to make a mistake as to the substance of the thing which is the subject of the agreement."
"CHAPTER II : OF CONTRACTS, VOIDABLE CONTRACTS AND VOID AGREEMENTS",19,"Voidability of agreements without free consent.— When consent to an agreement is caused by coercion, fraud or misrepresentation, the agreement is a contract voidable at the option of the party whose consent was so caused. A party to a contract whose consent was caused by fraud or misrepresentation, may, if he thinks fit, insist that the contract shall be performed, and that he shall be put in the position in which he would have been if the representations made had been true. Exception.— If such consent was caused by misrepresentation or by silence, fraudulent within the meaning of section 17, the contract, nevertheless, is not voidable, if the party whose consent was so caused had the means of discovering the truth with ordinary diligence. Explanation.— A fraud or misrepresentation which did not cause the consent to a contract of the party on whom such fraud was practised, or to whom such misrepresentation was made, does not render a contract voidable."
"CHAPTER II : OF CONTRACTS, VOIDABLE CONTRACTS AND VOID AGREEMENTS",19A,"Power to set aside contract induced by undue influence.— When consent to an agreement is caused by undue influence, the agreement is a contract voidable at the option of the party whose consent was so caused. Any such contract may be set aside either absolutely or, if the party who was entitled to avoid it has received any benefit thereunder, upon such terms and conditions as to the Court may seem just."
"CHAPTER II : OF CONTRACTS, VOIDABLE CONTRACTS AND VOID AGREEMENTS",20,"Agreement void where both parties are under mistake as to matter of fact.— Where both the parties to an agreement are under a mistake as to a matter of fact essential to the agreement, the agreement is void. Explanation.— An erroneous opinion as to the value of the thing which forms the subject-matter of the agreement, is not to be deemed a mistake as to a matter of fact."
"CHAPTER II : OF CONTRACTS, VOIDABLE CONTRACTS AND VOID AGREEMENTS",21,"Effect of mistakes as to law.— A contract is not voidable because it was caused by a mistake as to any law in force in [India]; but a mistake as to a law not in force in [India] has the same effect as a mistake of fact."
"CHAPTER II : OF CONTRACTS, VOIDABLE CONTRACTS AND VOID AGREEMENTS",22,"Contract caused by mistake of one party as to matter of fact.— A contract is not voidable merely because it was caused by one of the parties to it being under a mistake as to a matter of fact."
"CHAPTER II : OF CONTRACTS, VOIDABLE CONTRACTS AND VOID AGREEMENTS",23,"What considerations and objects are lawful, and what not.— The consideration or object of an agreement is lawful, unless— it is forbidden by law; or is of such a nature that if permitted, it would defeat the provisions of any law; or is fraudulent; or involves or implies injury to the person or property of another; or the Court regards it as immoral, or opposed to public policy. In each of these cases, the consideration or object of an agreement is said to be unlawful. Every agreement of which the object or consideration is unlawful is void."
"CHAPTER II : OF CONTRACTS, VOIDABLE CONTRACTS AND VOID AGREEMENTS Void agreements",24,"Agreements void, if considerations and objects unlawful in part.— If any part of a single consideration for one or more objects, or any one or any part of any one of several considerations for a single object, is unlawful, the agreement is void."

In any of these cases, such an agreement is a contract. Explanation 1.— Nothing in this section shall affect the validity, as between the donor and donee, of any gift actually made. Explanation 2.— An agreement to which the consent of the promisor is freely given is not void merely because the consideration is inadequate; but the inadequacy of the consideration may be taken into account by the Court in determining the question whether the consent of the promisor was freely given."
"CHAPTER II : OF CONTRACTS, VOIDABLE CONTRACTS AND VOID AGREEMENTS Void agreements",26,"Agreement in restraint of marriage, void.— Every agreement in restraint of the marriage of any person, other than a minor, is void."

Exception 1.— Saving of agreement not to carry on business of which good-will is sold.— One who sells the good-will of a business may agree with the buyer to refrain from carrying on a similar business, within specified local limits, so long as the buyer, or any person deriving title to the good-will from him, carries on a like business therein, provided that such limits appear to the Court reasonable, regard being had to the nature of the business."
"CHAPTER II : OF CONTRACTS, VOIDABLE CONTRACTS AND VOID AGREEMENTS Void agreements",28,"Agreements in restraint of legal proceedings, void.— Every agreement,— (a) by which any party thereto is restricted absolutely from enforcing his rights under or in respect of any contract, by the usual legal proceedings in the ordinary tribunals, or which limits the time within which he may thus enforce his rights; or (b) which extinguishes the rights of any party thereto, or discharges any party thereto, from any liability, under or in respect of any contract on the expiry of a specified period so as to restrict any party from enforcing his rights, is void to the extent. Exception 1.— Saving of contract to refer to arbitration dispute that may arise.— This section shall not render illegal a contract, by which two or more persons agree that any dispute which may arise between them in respect of any subject or class of subjects shall be referred to arbitration, and that only the amount awarded in such arbitration shall be recoverable in respect of the dispute so referred. Exception 2.— Saving of contract to refer questions that have already arisen.— Nor shall this section render illegal any contract in writing, by which two or more persons agree to refer to arbitration any question between them which has already arisen, or affect any provision of any law in force for the time being as to references to arbitration. Exception 3.— Saving of a guarantee agreement of a bank or a financial institution.— This section shall not render illegal a contract in writing by which any bank or financial institution stipulate a term in a guarantee or any agreement making a provision for guarantee for extinguishment of the rights or discharge of any party thereto from any liability under or in respect of such guarantee or agreement on the expiry of a specified period which is not less than one year from the date of occurring or non-occurring of a specified event for extinguishment or discharge of such party from the said liability."

CHAPTER IV : OF THE PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTS Contracts which must be performed,38,"Effect of refusal to accept offer of performance.—Where a promisor has made an offer of performance to the promisee, and the offer has not been accepted, the promisor is not responsible for non-performance, nor does he thereby lose his rights under the contract. Every such offer must fulfil the following conditions:— (1) it must be unconditional; (2) it must be made at a proper time and place, and under such circumstances that the person to whom it is made may have a reasonable opportunity of ascertaining that the person by whom it is made is able and willing there and then to do the whole of what he is bound by his promise to do; (3) if the offer is an offer to deliver anything to the promisee, the promisee must have a reasonable opportunity of seeing that the thing offered is the thing which the promisor is bound by his promise to deliver.

CHAPTER IV : OF THE PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTS By whom contracts must be performed,44,"Effect of release of one joint promisor.—Where two or more persons have made a joint promise, a release of one of such joint promisors by the promisee does not discharge the other joint promisor or joint promisors; neither does it free the joint promisors so released from responsibility to the other joint promisor or joint promisors."
CHAPTER IV : OF THE PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTS By whom contracts must be performed,45,"Devolution of joint rights.—When a person has made a promise to two or more persons jointly, then, unless a contrary intention appears from the contract, the right to claim performance rests, as between him and them, with them during their joint lives, and, after the death of any of them, with the representative of such deceased person jointly with the survivor or survivors, and, after the death of the last survivor, with the representatives of all jointly."

CHAPTER IV : OF THE PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTS Performance of reciprocal,51,"Promisor not bound to perform, unless reciprocal promisee ready and willing to perform.— When a contract consists of reciprocal promises to be simultaneously performed, no promisor need perform his promise unless the promisee is ready and willing to perform his reciprocal promise. Illustrations: (a) A and B contract that A shall deliver goods to B to be paid for by B on delivery. A need not deliver the goods, unless B is ready and willing to pay for the goods on delivery. B need not pay for the goods, unless A is ready and willing to deliver them on payment. (b) A and B contract that A shall deliver goods to B at a price to be paid by instalments, the first instalment to be paid on delivery.

CHAPTER IV : OF THE PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTS Performance of reciprocal,52,"Order of performance of reciprocal promises.— Where the order in which reciprocal promises are to be performed is expressly fixed by the contract, they shall be performed in that order; and where the order is not expressly fixed by the contract, they shall be performed in that order which the nature of the transaction requires. Illustrations: (a) A contracts with B to build a house for B at a fixed price. A’s promise to build the house must be performed before B’s promise to pay for it. (b) A contracts with B to make over his stock-in-trade to B at a fixed price, and B promises to give security for the payment of the money. A’s promise need not be performed until the security is given, for the nature of the transaction requires that A should have security before he delivers up his stock."

Illustration: A and B contract that B shall execute certain work for A for a thousand rupees. B is ready and willing to execute the work accordingly, but A prevents him from doing so. The contract is voidable at the option of B; and, if he elects to rescind it, he is entitled to recover from A compensation for any loss which he has incurred by its non-performance."
CHAPTER IV : OF THE PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTS Performance of reciprocal,54,"Effect of default as to that promise which should be first performed, in contract consisting of reciprocal promises.— When a contract consists of reciprocal promises, such that one of them cannot be performed, or that its performance cannot be claimed till the other has been performed, and the promisor of the promise last mentioned fails to perform it, such promisor cannot claim the performance of the reciprocal promise, and must make compensation to the other party to the contract for any loss which such other party may sustain by the non-performance of the contract. Illustrations: (a) A hires B’s ship to take in and convey, from Calcutta to the Mauritius, a cargo to be provided by A, B receiving a certain freight for its conveyance. A does not provide any cargo for the ship. A cannot claim the performance of B’s promise, and must make compensation to B for the loss which B sustains by the non-performance of the contract. (b) A contracts with B to execute certain builder’s work for a fixed price, B supplying the scaffolding and timber necessary for the work. B refuses to furnish any scaffolding or timber, and the work cannot be executed. A need not execute the work, and B is bound to make compensation to A for any loss caused to him by the non-performance of the contract. (c) A contracts with B to deliver to him, at a specified price, certain merchandise on board a ship which cannot arrive for a month, and B engages to pay for the merchandise within a week from the date of the contract. B does not pay within the week. A’s promise to deliver need not be performed, and B must make compensation. (d) A promises B to sell him one hundred bales of merchandise, to be delivered next day, and B promises A to pay for them within a month. A does not deliver according to his promise. B’s promise to pay need not be performed, and A must make compensation."
CHAPTER IV : OF THE PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTS Performance of reciprocal,55,"Effect of failure to perform at fixed time, in contract in which time is essential.— When a party to a contract promises to do a certain thing at or before a specified time, or certain things at or before specified times, and fails to do any such thing at or before the specified time, the contract, or so much of it as has not been performed, becomes voidable at the option of the promisee, if the intention of the parties was that time should be of the essence of the contract. Effect of such failure when time is not essential.— If it was not the intention of the parties that time should be of the essence of the contract, the contract does not become voidable by the failure to do such thing at or before the specified time; but the promisee is entitled to compensation from the promisor for any loss occasioned to him by such failure. Effect of acceptance of performance at time other than that agreed upon.— If, in case of a contract voidable on account of the promisor’s failure to perform his promise at the time agreed, the promisee accepts performance of such promise at any time other than that agreed, the promisee cannot claim compensation for any loss occasioned by the non-performance of the promise at the time agreed, unless, at the time of such acceptance, he gives notice to the promisor of his intention to do so. STATE AMENDMENT (Uttar Pradesh): In section 55 of the Principal Act, in the third paragraph, for the words 'unless at the time of such acceptance he gives notice to the promiser of his intention to do so', the words 'where at the time of such acceptance he has waived his right to do so' shall be substituted."
CHAPTER IV : OF THE PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTS Performance of reciprocal,56,"Agreement to do impossible act.— An agreement to do an act impossible in itself is void. Contract to do an act afterwards becoming impossible or unlawful.— A contract to do an act which, after the contract is made, becomes impossible, or, by reason of some event which the promisor could not prevent, unlawful, becomes void when the act becomes impossible or unlawful. Compensation for loss through non-performance of act known to be impossible or unlawful.— Where one person has promised to do something which he knew, or, with reasonable diligence, might have known, and which the promisee did not know, to be impossible or unlawful, such promisor must make compensation to such promisee for any loss which such promisee sustains through the non-performance of the promise. Illustrations: (a) A agrees with B to discover treasure by magic. The agreement is void. (b) A and B contract to marry each other. Before the time fixed for the marriage, A goes mad. The contract becomes void. (c) A contracts to marry B, being already married to C, and being forbidden by the law to which he is subject to practise polygamy, A must make compensation to B for the loss caused to her by the non-performance of his promise. (d) A contracts to take in cargo for B at a foreign port. A’s Government afterwards declares war against the country in which the port is situated. The contract becomes void when war is declared. (e) A contracts to act at a theatre for six months in consideration of a sum paid in advance by B. On several occasions A is too ill to act. The contract to act on those occasions becomes void."
CHAPTER IV : OF THE PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTS Performance of reciprocal,57,"Reciprocal promise to do things legal, and also other things illegal.— Where persons reciprocally promise, firstly, to do certain things which are legal, and, secondly, under specified circumstances, to do certain other things which are illegal, the first set of promises is a contract, but the second is a void agreement. Illustration: A and B agree that A shall sell B a house for 10,000 rupees, but that, if B uses it as a gambling house, he shall pay A 50,000 rupees for it. The first set of reciprocal promises, namely, to sell the house and to pay 10,000 rupees for it, is a contract. The second set is for an unlawful object, namely, that B may use the house as a gambling house, and is a void agreement."
CHAPTER IV : OF THE PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTS Performance of reciprocal,58,"Alternative promise, one branch being illegal.— In the case of an alternative promise, one branch of which is legal and the other illegal, the legal branch alone can be enforced. Illustration: A and B agree that A shall pay B 1,000 rupees, for which B shall afterwards deliver to A either rice or smuggled opium. This is a valid contract to deliver rice, and a void agreement as to the opium."
CHAPTER IV : OF THE PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTS Appropriation of payments,59,"Application of payment where debt to be discharged is indicated.— Where a debtor, owing several distinct debts to one person, makes a payment to him, either with express intimation, or under circumstances implying, that the payment is to be applied to the discharge of some particular debt, the payment, if accepted, must be applied accordingly. Illustrations: (a) A owes B, among other debts, 1,000 rupees upon a promissory note which falls due on the first June. He owes B no other debt of that amount. On the first June, A pays to B 1,000 rupees. The payment is to be applied to the discharge of the promissory note. (b) A owes to B, among other debts, the sum of 567 rupees. B writes to A and demands payment of this sum. A sends to B 567 rupees. This payment is to be applied to the discharge of the debt of which B had demanded payment."
CHAPTER IV : OF THE PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTS Appropriation of payments,60,"Application of payment where debt to be discharged is not indicated.— Where the debtor has omitted to intimate and there are no other circumstances indicating to which debt the payment is to be applied, the creditor may apply it at his discretion to any lawful debt actually due and payable to him from the debtor, whether its recovery is or is not barred by the law in force for the time being as to the limitation of suits."
CHAPTER IV : OF THE PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTS Appropriation of payments,61,"Application of payment where neither party appropriates.— Where neither party makes any appropriation, the payment shall be applied in discharge of the debts in order of time, whether they are or are not barred by the law in force for the time being as to the limitation of suits. If the debts are of equal standing, the payment shall be applied in discharge of each proportionably."
CHAPTER IV : OF THE PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTS Contracts which need not be performed,62,"Effect of novation, rescission, and alteration of contract.— If the parties to a contract agree to substitute a new contract for it, or to rescind or alter it, the original contract, need not be performed. Illustrations: (a) A owes money to B under a contract. It is agreed between A, B and C that B shall thenceforth accept C as his debtor, instead of A. The old debt of A to B is at an end, and a new debt from C to B has been contracted. (b) A owes B 10,000 rupees. A enters into an arrangement with B and gives B a mortgage of his (A’s) estate for 5,000 rupees in place of the debt of 10,000 rupees. This is a new contract and extinguishes the old. (c) A owes B 1,000 rupees under a contract. B orders A to credit C with 1,000 rupees in his books, but C does not assent to the arrangement. B still owes C 1,000 rupees, and no new contract has been entered into."
CHAPTER IV : OF THE PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTS Contracts which need not be performed,63,"Promisee may dispense with or remit performance of promise.— Every promisee may dispense with or remit, wholly or in part, the performance of the promise made to him, or may extend the time for such performance, or may accept instead of it any satisfaction which he thinks fit. Illustrations: (a) A promises to paint a picture for B. B afterwards forbids him to do so. A is no longer bound to perform the promise. (b) A owes B 5,000 rupees. A pays to B, and B accepts, in satisfaction of the whole debt, 2,000 rupees paid at the time and place at which the 5,000 rupees were payable. The whole debt is discharged. (c) A owes B 5,000 rupees. C pays to B 1,000 rupees, and B accepts them, in satisfaction of his claim on A. This payment is a discharge of the whole claim. (d) A owes B, under a contract, a sum of money, the amount of which has not been ascertained. A, without ascertaining the amount, gives to B, and B, in satisfaction thereof, accepts, the sum of 2,000 rupees. This is a discharge of the whole debt, whatever may be its amount. (e) A owes B 2,000 rupees, and is also indebted to other creditors. A makes an arrangement with his creditors, including B, to pay them a composition of eight annas in the rupee upon their respective demands. Payment to B of 1,000 rupees is a discharge of B’s demand."
CHAPTER IV : OF THE PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTS Contracts which need not be performed,64,"Consequences of rescission of voidable contract.— When a person at whose option a contract is voidable rescinds it, the other party thereto need not perform any promise therein contained in which he is promisor. The party rescinding a voidable contract shall, if he have received any benefit thereunder from another party to such contract, restore such benefit, so far as may be, to the person from whom it was received."
CHAPTER IV : OF THE PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTS Contracts which need not be performed,65,"Obligation of person who has received advantage under void agreement, or contract that becomes void.— When an agreement is discovered to be void, or when a contract becomes void, any person who has received any advantage under such agreement or contract is bound to restore it, or to make compensation for it to the person from whom he received it. Illustrations: (a) A pays B 1,000 rupees in consideration of B’s promising to marry C, A’s daughter. C is dead at the time of the promise. The agreement is void, but B must repay A the 1,000 rupees. (b) A contracts with B to deliver to him 250 maunds of rice before the first of May. A delivers 130 maunds only before that day, and none after. B retains the 130 maunds after the first of May. He is bound to pay A for them. (c) A, a singer, contracts with B, the manager of a theatre, to sing at his theatre for two nights in every week during the next two months, and B engages to pay her a hundred rupees for each night’s performance. On the sixth night, A wilfully absents herself from the theatre, and B, in consequence, rescinds the contract. B must pay A for the five nights on which she had sung. (d) A contracts to sing for B at a concert for 1,000 rupees, which are paid in advance. A is too ill to sing. A is not bound to make compensation to B for the loss of the profits which B would have made if A had been able to sing, but must refund to B the 1,000 rupees paid in advance."
CHAPTER IV : OF THE PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTS Contracts which need not be performed,66,"Mode of communicating or revoking rescission of voidable contract.— The rescission of a voidable contract may be communicated or revoked in the same manner, and subject to the same rules, as apply to the communication or revocation of a proposal."
CHAPTER IV : OF THE PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTS Contracts which need not be performed,67,"Effect of neglect of promisee to afford promisor reasonable facilities for performance.— If any promisee neglects or refuses to afford the promisor reasonable facilities for the performance of his promise, the promisor is excused by such neglect or refusal as to any non-performance caused thereby. Illustration: A contracts with B to repair B’s house. B neglects or refuses to point out to A the places in which his house requires repair. A is excused for the non-performance of the contract if it is caused by such neglect or refusal."
CHAPTER V : OF CERTAIN RELATIONS RESEMBLING THOSE CREATED BY CONTRACT,68,"Claim for necessaries supplied to person incapable of contracting, or on his account.— If a person, incapable of entering into a contract, or any one whom he is legally bound to support, is supplied by another person with necessaries suited to his condition in life, the person who has furnished such supplies is entitled to be reimbursed from the property of such incapable person. Illustrations: (a) A supplies B, a lunatic, with necessaries suitable to his condition in life. A is entitled to be reimbursed from B’s property. (b) A supplies the wife and children of B, a lunatic, with necessaries suitable to their condition in life. A is entitled to be reimbursed from B’s property."
CHAPTER V : OF CERTAIN RELATIONS RESEMBLING THOSE CREATED BY CONTRACT,69,"Reimbursement of person paying money due by another, in payment of which he is interested.— A person who is interested in the payment of money which another is bound by law to pay, and who therefore pays it, is entitled to be reimbursed by the other. Illustration: B holds land in Bengal, on a lease granted by A, the zamindar. The revenue payable by A to the Government being in arrear, his land is advertised for sale by the Government. Under the revenue law, the consequence of such sale will be the annulment of B’s lease. B, to prevent the sale and the consequent annulment of his own lease, pays to the Government the sum due from A. A is bound to make good to B the amount so paid."
CHAPTER V : OF CERTAIN RELATIONS RESEMBLING THOSE CREATED BY CONTRACT,70,"Obligation of person enjoying benefit of non-gratuitous act.— Where a person lawfully does anything for another person, or delivers anything to him, not intending to do so gratuitously, and such other person enjoys the benefit thereof, the latter is bound to make compensation to the former in respect of, or to restore, the thing so done or delivered. Illustrations: (a) A, a tradesman, leaves goods at B’s house by mistake. B treats the goods as his own. He is bound to pay A for them. (b) A saves B’s property from fire. A is not entitled to compensation from B, if the circumstances show that he intended to act gratuitously."
CHAPTER V : OF CERTAIN RELATIONS RESEMBLING THOSE CREATED BY CONTRACT,71,"Responsibility of finder of goods.— A person who finds goods belonging to another, and takes them into his custody, is subject to the same responsibility as a bailee."
CHAPTER V : OF CERTAIN RELATIONS RESEMBLING THOSE CREATED BY CONTRACT,72,"Liability of person to whom money is paid, or thing delivered, by mistake or under coercion.— A person to whom money has been paid, or anything delivered, by mistake or under coercion, must repay or return it. Illustrations: (a) A and B jointly owe 100 rupees to C, A alone pays the amount to C, and B, not knowing this fact, pays 100 rupees over again to C. C is bound to repay the amount to B. (b) A railway company refuses to deliver up certain goods to the consignee, except upon the payment of an illegal charge for carriage. The consignee pays the sum charged in order to obtain the goods. He is entitled to recover so much of the charge as was illegally excessive."
CHAPTER VI : OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF BREACH OF CONTRACT,73,"Compensation for loss or damage caused by breach of contract.— When a contract has been broken, the party who suffers by such breach is entitled to receive, from the party who has broken the contract, compensation for any loss or damage caused to him thereby, which naturally arose in the usual course of things from such breach, or which the parties knew, when they made the contract, to be likely to result from the breach of it. Such compensation is not to be given for any remote and indirect loss or damage sustained by reason of the breach. Compensation for failure to discharge obligation resembling those created by contract.— When an obligation resembling those created by contract has been incurred and has not been discharged, any person injured by the failure to discharge it is entitled to receive the same compensation from the party in default, as if such person had contracted to discharge it and had broken his contract. Explanation.— In estimating the loss or damage arising from a breach of contract, the means which existed of remedying the inconvenience caused by the non-performance of the contract must be taken into account."
CHAPTER VI : OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF BREACH OF CONTRACT,74,"Compensation for breach of contract where penalty stipulated for.— When a contract has been broken, if a sum is named in the contract as the amount to be paid in case of such breach, or if the contract contains any other stipulation by way of penalty, the party complaining of the breach is entitled, whether or not actual damage or loss is proved to have been caused thereby, to receive from the party who has broken the contract reasonable compensation not exceeding the amount so named or, as the case may be, the penalty stipulated for. Explanation.— A stipulation for increased interest from the date of default may be a stipulation by way of penalty. Exception.— When any person enters into any bail-bond, recognizance or other instrument of the same nature, or, under the provisions of any law, or under the orders of the Central Government or of any State Government, gives any bond for the performance of any public duty or act in which the public are interested, he shall be liable, upon breach of the condition of any such instrument, to pay the whole sum mentioned therein. Explanation.— A person who enters into a contract with Government does not necessarily thereby undertake any public duty, or promise to do an act in which the public are interested."
CHAPTER VI : OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF BREACH OF CONTRACT,75,"Party rightfully rescinding contract, entitled to compensation.— A person who rightfully rescinds a contract is entitled to compensation for any damage which he has sustained through the non-fulfilment of the contract. Illustration: A, a singer, contracts with B, the manager of a theatre, to sing at his theatre for two nights in every week during the next two months, and B engages to pay her 100 rupees for each night’s performance. On the sixth night, A wilfully absents herself from the theatre, and B, in consequence, rescinds the contract. B is entitled to claim compensation for the damage which he has sustained through the non-fulfilment of the contract."

CHAPTER VIII : OF INDEMNITY AND GUARANTEE,124,"'Contract of indemnity' defined.— A contract by which one party promises to save the other from loss caused to him by the conduct of the promisor himself, or by the conduct of any other person, is called a 'contract of indemnity'. Illustration: A contracts to indemnify B against the consequences of any proceedings which C may take against B in respect of a certain sum of 200 rupees. This is a contract of indemnity."
CHAPTER VIII : OF INDEMNITY AND GUARANTEE,125,"Rights of indemnity-holder when sued.— The promisee in a contract of indemnity, acting within the scope of his authority, is entitled to recover from the promisor— (1) all damages which he may be compelled to pay in any suit in respect of any matter to which the promise to indemnify applies; (2) all costs which he may be compelled to pay in any such suit if, in bringing or defending it, he did not contravene the orders of the promisor, and acted as it would have been prudent for him to act in the absence of any contract of indemnity, or if the promisor authorized him to bring or defend the suit; (3) all sums which he may have paid under the terms of any compromise of any such suit, if the compromise was not contrary to the orders of the promisor, and was one which it would have been prudent for the promisee to make in the absence of any contract of indemnity, or if the promisor authorized him to compromise the suit."
CHAPTER VIII : OF INDEMNITY AND GUARANTEE,126,"'Contract of guarantee', 'surety', 'principal debtor' and 'creditor'.— A 'contract of guarantee' is a contract to perform the promise, or discharge the liability, of a third person in case of his default. The person who gives the guarantee is called the 'surety'; the person in respect of whose default the guarantee is given is called the 'principal debtor', and the person to whom the guarantee is given is called the 'creditor'. A guarantee may be either oral or written."
CHAPTER VIII : OF INDEMNITY AND GUARANTEE,127,"Consideration for guarantee.— Anything done, or any promise made, for the benefit of the principal debtor, may be a sufficient consideration to the surety for giving the guarantee. Illustrations: (a) B requests A to sell and deliver to him goods on credit. A agrees to do so, provided C will guarantee the payment of the price of the goods. C promises to guarantee the payment in consideration of A’s promise to deliver the goods. This is a sufficient consideration for C’s promise. (b) A sells and delivers goods to B. C afterwards requests A to forbear to sue B for the debt for a year, and promises that, if he does so, C will pay for them in default of payment by B. A agrees to forbear as requested. This is a sufficient consideration for C’s promise. (c) A sells and delivers goods to B. C afterwards, without consideration, agrees to pay for them in default of B. The agreement is void."
CHAPTER VIII : OF INDEMNITY AND GUARANTEE,128,"Surety’s liability.— The liability of the surety is co-extensive with that of the principal debtor, unless it is otherwise provided by the contract. Illustration: A guarantees to B the payment of a bill of exchange by C, the acceptor. The bill is dishonoured by C. A is liable, not only for the amount of the bill, but also for any interest and charges which may have become due on it."
CHAPTER VIII : OF INDEMNITY AND GUARANTEE,129,"'Continuing guarantee'.— A guarantee which extends to a series of transactions, is called a 'continuing guarantee'. Illustrations: (a) A, in consideration that B will employ C in collecting the rent of B’s zamindari, promises B to be responsible, to the amount of 5,000 rupees, for the due collection and payment by C of those rents. This is a continuing guarantee. (b) A guarantees payment to B, a tea-dealer, to the amount of £100, for any tea he may from time to time supply to C. B supplies C with tea to above the value of £100, and C pays B for it. Afterwards, B supplies C with tea to the value of £200. C fails to pay. The guarantee given by A was a continuing guarantee, and he is accordingly liable to B to the extent of £100. (c) A guarantees payment to B of the price of five sacks of flour to be delivered by B to C and to be paid for in a month. B delivers five sacks to C. C pays for them. Afterwards B delivers four sacks to C, which C does not pay for. The guarantee given by A was not a continuing guarantee, and accordingly he is not liable for the price of the four sacks."
CHAPTER VIII : OF INDEMNITY AND GUARANTEE,130,"Revocation of continuing guarantee.— A continuing guarantee may at any time be revoked by the surety, as to future transactions, by notice to the creditor. Illustrations: (a) A, in consideration of B’s discounting, at A’s request, bills of exchange for C, guarantees to B, for twelve months, the due payment of all such bills to the extent of 5,000 rupees. B discounts bills for C to the extent of 2,000 rupees. Afterwards, at the end of three months, A revokes the guarantee. This revocation discharges A from all liability to B for any subsequent discount. But A is liable to B for the 2,000 rupees, on default of C. (b) A guarantees to B, to the extent of 10,000 rupees, that C shall pay all the bills that B shall draw upon him. B draws upon C. C accepts the bill. A gives notice of revocation. C dishonours the bill at maturity. A is liable upon his guarantee."
CHAPTER VIII : OF INDEMNITY AND GUARANTEE,131,"Revocation of continuing guarantee by surety’s death.— The death of the surety operates, in the absence of any contract to the contrary, as a revocation of a continuing guarantee, so far as regards future transactions."
CHAPTER VIII : OF INDEMNITY AND GUARANTEE,132,"Liability of two persons, primarily liable, not affected by arrangement between them that one shall be surety on other’s default.— Where two persons contract with a third person to undertake a certain liability, and also contract with each other that one of them shall be liable only on the default of the other, the third person not being a party to such contract, the liability of each of such two persons to the third person under the first contract is not affected by the existence of the second contract, although such third person may have been aware of its existence. Illustration: A and B make a joint and several promissory note to C. A makes it, in fact, as surety for B, and C knows this at the time when the note is made. The fact that A, to the knowledge of C, made the note as surety for B, is no answer to a suit by C against A upon the note."
CHAPTER VIII : OF INDEMNITY AND GUARANTEE,133,"Discharge of surety by variance in terms of contract.— Any variance, made without the surety’s consent, in the terms of the contract between the principal debtor and the creditor, discharges the surety as to transactions subsequent to the variance. Illustrations: (a) A becomes surety to C for B’s conduct as a manager in C’s bank. Afterwards, B and C contract, without A’s consent, that B’s salary shall be raised, and that he shall become liable for one-fourth of the losses on overdrafts. B allows a customer to overdraw, and the bank loses a sum of money. A is discharged from his suretyship by the variance made without his consent, and is not liable to make good this loss. (b) A guarantees C against the misconduct of B in an office to which B is appointed by C, and of which the duties are defined by an Act of the Legislature. By a subsequent Act, the nature of the office is materially altered. Afterwards, B misconducts himself. A is discharged by the change from future liability under his guarantee, though the misconduct of B is in respect of a duty not affected by the later Act. (c) C agrees to appoint B as his clerk to sell goods at a yearly salary, upon A’s becoming surety to C for B’s duly accounting for moneys received by him as such clerk. Afterwards, without A’s knowledge or consent, C and B agree that B should be paid by a commission on the goods sold by him and not by a fixed salary. A is not liable for subsequent misconduct of B. (d) A gives to C a continuing guarantee to the extent of 3,000 rupees for any oil supplied by C to B on credit. Afterwards B becomes embarrassed, and, without the knowledge of A, B and C contract that C shall continue to supply B with oil for ready money, and that the payments shall be applied to the then existing debts between B and C. A is not liable on his guarantee for any goods supplied after this new arrangement. (e) C contracts to lend B 5,000 rupees on the 1st March. A guarantees repayment. C pays the 5,000 rupees to B on the 1st January. A is discharged from his liability, as the contract has been varied, inasmuch as C might sue B for the money before the 1st of March."
CHAPTER VIII : OF INDEMNITY AND GUARANTEE,134,"Discharge of surety by release or discharge of principal debtor.— The surety is discharged by any contract between the creditor and the principal debtor, by which the principal debtor is released, or by any act or omission of the creditor, the legal consequence of which is the discharge of the principal debtor. Illustrations: (a) A gives a guarantee to C for goods to be supplied by C to B. C supplies goods to B, and afterwards B becomes embarrassed and contracts with his creditors (including C) to assign to them his property in consideration of their releasing him from their demands. Here B is released from his debt by the contract with C, and A is discharged from his suretyship. (b) A contracts with B to grow a crop of indigo on A’s land and to deliver it to B at a fixed rate, and C guarantees A’s performance of this contract. B diverts a stream of water which is necessary for the irrigation of A’s land and thereby prevents him from raising the indigo. C is no longer liable on his guarantee. (c) A contracts with B for a fixed price to build a house for B within a stipulated time, B supplying the necessary timber. C guarantees A’s performance of the contract. B omits to supply the timber. C is discharged from his suretyship."
CHAPTER VIII : OF INDEMNITY AND GUARANTEE,135,"Discharge of surety when creditor compounds with, gives time to, or agrees not to sue, principal debtor.— A contract between the creditor and the principal debtor, by which the creditor makes a composition with, or promises to give time to, or not to sue, the principal debtor, discharges the surety, unless the surety assents to such contract."
CHAPTER VIII : OF INDEMNITY AND GUARANTEE,136,"Surety not discharged when agreement made with third person to give time to principal debtor.— Where a contract to give time to the principal debtor is made by the creditor with a third person, and not with the principal debtor, the surety is not discharged. Illustration: C, the holder of an overdue bill of exchange drawn by A as surety for B, and accepted by B, contracts with M to give time to B. A is not discharged."
CHAPTER VIII : OF INDEMNITY AND GUARANTEE,137,"Creditor’s forbearance to sue does not discharge surety.— Mere forbearance on the part of the creditor to sue the principal debtor or to enforce any other remedy against him does not, in the absence of any provision in the guarantee to the contrary, discharge the surety. Illustration: B owes to C a debt guaranteed by A. The debt becomes payable. C does not sue B for a year after the debt has become payable. A is not discharged from his suretyship."
CHAPTER VIII : OF INDEMNITY AND GUARANTEE,138,"Release of one co-surety does not discharge others.— Where there are co-sureties, a release by the creditor of one of them does not discharge the others; neither does it free the surety so released from his responsibility to the other sureties."
CHAPTER VIII : OF INDEMNITY AND GUARANTEE,139,"Discharge of surety by creditor’s act or omission impairing surety’s eventual remedy.— If the creditor does any act which is inconsistent with the rights of the surety, or omits to do any act which his duty to the surety requires him to do, and the eventual remedy of the surety himself against the principal debtor is thereby impaired, the surety is discharged. Illustrations: (a) B contracts to build a ship for C for a given sum, to be paid by instalments as the work reaches certain stages. A becomes surety to C for B’s due performance of the contract. C, without the knowledge of A, prepays to B the last two instalments. A is discharged by this prepayment. (b) C lends money to B on the security of a joint and several promissory note made in C’s favour by B, and by A as surety for B, together with a bill of sale of B’s furniture, which gives power to C to sell the furniture, and apply the proceeds in discharge of the note. Subsequently, C sells the furniture, but, owing to his misconduct and wilful negligence, only a small price is realized. A is discharged from liability on the note. (c) A puts M as apprentice to B, and gives a guarantee to B for M’s fidelity. B promises on his part that he will, at least once a month, see M make up the cash. B omits to see this done as promised, and M embezzles. A is not liable to B on his guarantee."
CHAPTER VIII : OF INDEMNITY AND GUARANTEE,140,"Rights of surety on payment or performance.— Where a guaranteed debt has become due, or default of the principal debtor to perform a guaranteed duty has taken place, the surety upon payment or performance of all that he is liable for, is invested with all the rights which the creditor had against the principal debtor."
CHAPTER VIII : OF INDEMNITY AND GUARANTEE,141,"Surety’s right to benefit of creditor’s securities.— A surety is entitled to the benefit of every security which the creditor has against the principal debtor at the time when the contract of suretyship is entered into, whether the surety knows of the existence of such security or not; and if the creditor loses, or, without the consent of the surety, parts with such security, the surety is discharged to the extent of the value of the security. Illustrations: (a) C, advances to B, his tenant, 2,000 rupees on the guarantee of A. C has also a further security for the 2,000 rupees by a mortgage of B’s furniture. C cancels the mortgage. B becomes insolvent and C sues A on his guarantee. A is discharged from liability to the amount of the value of the furniture. (b) C, a creditor, whose advance to B is secured by a decree, receives also a guarantee for that advance from A. C afterwards takes B’s goods in execution under the decree, and then, without the knowledge of A, withdraws the execution. A is discharged. (c) A, as surety for B, makes a bond jointly with B to C, to secure a loan from C to B. Afterwards, C obtains from B a further security for the same debt. Subsequently, C gives up the further security. A is not discharged."
CHAPTER VIII : OF INDEMNITY AND GUARANTEE,142,"Guarantee obtained by misrepresentation invalid.— Any guarantee which has been obtained by means of misrepresentation made by the creditor, or with his knowledge and assent, concerning a material part of the transaction, is invalid."
CHAPTER VIII : OF INDEMNITY AND GUARANTEE,143,"Guarantee obtained by concealment invalid.— Any guarantee which the creditor has obtained by means of keeping silence as to material circumstances, is invalid. Illustrations: (a) A engages B as clerk to collect money for him. B fails to account for some of his receipts, and A in consequence calls upon him to furnish security for his duty accounting. C gives his guarantee for B’s duty accounting. A does not acquaint C with B’s previous conduct. B afterwards makes default. The guarantee is invalid. (b) A guarantees to C payment for iron to be supplied by him to B to the amount of 2,000 tons. B and C have privately agreed that B should pay five rupees per ton beyond the market price, such excess to be applied in liquidation of an old debt. This agreement is concealed from A. A is not liable as a surety."
CHAPTER VIII : OF INDEMNITY AND GUARANTEE,144,"Guarantee on contract that creditor shall not act on it until co-surety joins.— Where a person gives a guarantee upon a contract that the creditor shall not act upon it until another person has joined in it as co-surety, the guarantee is not valid if that other person does not join."

(b) C lends B a sum of money, and A, at the request of B, accepts a bill of exchange drawn by B upon A to secure the amount. C, the holder of the bill, demands payment of it from A, and, on A’s refusal to pay, sues him upon the bill. A, not having reasonable grounds for so doing, defends the suit, and has to pay the amount of the bill and costs. He can recover from B the amount of the bill, but not the sum paid for costs, as there was no real ground for defending the action. (c) A guarantees to C, to the extent of 2,000 rupees, payment for rice to be supplied by C to B. C supplies to B rice to a less amount than 2,000 rupees, but obtains from A payment of the sum of 2,000 rupees in respect of the rice supplied. A cannot recover from B more than the price of the rice actually supplied."
CHAPTER VIII : OF INDEMNITY AND GUARANTEE,146,"Co-sureties liable to contribute equally.— Where two or more persons are co-sureties for the same debt or duty, either jointly or severally, and whether under the same or different contracts, and whether with or without the knowledge of each other, the co-sureties, in the absence of any contract to the contrary, are liable, as between themselves, to pay each an equal share of the whole debt, or of that part of it which remains unpaid by the principal debtor.

The person delivering the goods is called the 'bailor'. The person to whom they are delivered is called the 'bailee'. Explanation.— If a person already in possession of the goods of another contracts to hold them as a bailee, he thereby becomes the bailee, and the owner becomes the bailor of such goods, although they may not have been delivered by way of bailment."
CHAPTER IX : OF BAILMENT,149,"Delivery to bailee how made.— The delivery to the bailee may be made by doing anything which has the effect of putting the goods in the possession of the intended bailee or of any person authorized to hold them on his behalf."
CHAPTER IX : OF BAILMENT,150,"Bailor’s duty to disclose faults in goods bailed.— The bailor is bound to disclose to the bailee faults in the goods bailed, of which the bailor is aware, and which materially interfere with the use of them, or expose the bailee to extraordinary risks; and if he does not make such disclosure, he is responsible for damage arising to the bailee directly from such faults. If the goods are bailed for hire, the bailor is responsible for such damage, whether he was or was not aware of the existence of such faults in the goods bailed. Illustrations: (a) A lends a horse, which he knows to be vicious, to B. He does not disclose the fact that the horse is vicious. The horse runs away. B is thrown and injured. A is responsible to B for damage sustained. (b) A hires a carriage of B. The carriage is unsafe, though B is not aware of it, and A is injured. B is responsible to A for the injury."
CHAPTER IX : OF BAILMENT,151,"Care to be taken by bailee.— In all cases of bailment the bailee is bound to take as much care of the goods bailed to him as a man of ordinary prudence would, under similar circumstances, take of his own goods of the same bulk, quality and value as the goods bailed."
CHAPTER IX : OF BAILMENT,152,"Bailee when not liable for loss, etc., of thing bailed.— The bailee, in the absence of any special contract, is not responsible for the loss, destruction or deterioration of the thing bailed, if he has taken the amount of care of it described in section 151."
CHAPTER IX : OF BAILMENT,153,"Termination of bailment by bailee’s act inconsistent with conditions.— A contract of bailment is avoidable at the option of the bailor, if the bailee does any act with regard to the goods bailed, inconsistent with the conditions of the bailment. Illustration: A lets to B, for hire, a horse for his own riding. B drives the horse in his carriage. This is, at the option of A, a termination of the bailment."
CHAPTER IX : OF BAILMENT,154,"Liability of bailee making unauthorized use of goods bailed.— If the bailee makes any use of the goods bailed which is not according to the conditions of the bailment, he is liable to make compensation to the bailor for any damage arising to the goods from or during such use of them.

Illustration: A bails 100 bales of cotton marked with a particular mark to B. B, without A’s consent, mixes the 100 bales with other bales of his own, bearing a different mark. A is entitled to have his 100 bales returned, and B is bound to bear all the expense incurred in the separation of the bales, and any other incidental damage."
CHAPTER IX : OF BAILMENT,157,"Effect of mixture, without bailor’s consent, when the goods cannot be separated.— If the bailee, without the consent of the bailor, mixes the goods of the bailor with his own goods, in such a manner that it is impossible to separate the goods bailed from the other goods, and deliver them back, the bailor is entitled to be compensated by the bailee for the loss of the goods. Illustration: A bails a barrel of Cape flour worth Rs. 45 to B. B, without A’s consent, mixes the flour with country flour of his own, worth only Rs. 25 a barrel. B must compensate A for the loss of his flour."

CHAPTER IX : OF BAILMENT,159,"Restoration of goods lent gratuitously.— The lender of a thing for use may at any time require its return, if the loan was gratuitous, even though he lent it for a specified time or purpose. But if, on the faith of such loan made for a specified time or purpose, the borrower has acted in such a manner that the return of the thing lent before the time agreed upon would cause him loss exceeding the benefit actually derived by him from the loan, the lender must, if he compels the return, indemnify the borrower for the amount in which the loss so occasioned exceeds the benefit so derived."
CHAPTER IX : OF BAILMENT,160,"Return of goods bailed, on expiration of time or accomplishment of purpose.— It is the duty of the bailee to return, or deliver according to the bailor’s directions, the goods bailed, without demand, as soon as the time for which they were bailed has expired, or the purpose for which they were bailed has been accomplished."
CHAPTER IX : OF BAILMENT,161,"Bailee’s responsibility when goods are not duly returned.— If, by the default of the bailee, the goods are not returned, delivered or tendered at the proper time, he is responsible to the bailor for any loss, destruction or deterioration of the goods from that time."

CHAPTER IX : OF BAILMENT,169,"When finder of thing commonly on sale may sell it.— When a thing which is commonly the subject of sale is lost, if the owner cannot with reasonable diligence be found, or if he refuses, upon demand, to pay the lawful charges of the finder, the finder may sell it— (1) when the thing is in danger of perishing or of losing the greater part of its value, or, (2) when the lawful charges of the finder, in respect of the thing found, amount to two-thirds of its value."
CHAPTER IX : OF BAILMENT,170,"Bailee’s particular lien.— Where the bailee has, in accordance with the purpose of the bailment, rendered any service involving the exercise of labour or skill in respect of the goods bailed, he has, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, a right to retain such goods until he receives due remuneration for the services he has rendered in respect of them. Illustrations: (a) A delivers a rough diamond to B, a jeweller, to be cut and polished, which is accordingly done. B is entitled to retain the stone till he is paid for the services he has rendered.
